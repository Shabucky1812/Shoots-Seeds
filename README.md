# Shoots & Seeds
The main goal of this website is to market the imagined business: 'Shoots & Seeds', a new retailer of plants and seeds. The site intends to educate new users about the business in a simple and endearing way and also have use for returning users as well. Shoots & Seeds will be valuable to users as it provides updates on new stock, allows users to enter a monthly competition and provides links to various social outlets.

## UX
### User Stories:  
  -The goal of this site for new users is to market the business in a non-obtrusive and enjoyable way. New users should quickly be able to know how to navigate the pages and absorb all of the content efficiently. They should learn some basics about Shoots & Seeds and also the opening times. Additionally, first-time users should be intrigued by the monthly new stock and competition and desire to return to the website at a later date.  
  -Returning users should be able to navigate the pages of the site quickly and see what new stock is available each month. Each section of the "what's new?" page should be informative and promote the stock to the user. Frequent users are also encouraged to provide feedback and enter the monthly competition via the "competition" page. The form should be simple and effective to increase the chances of user interaction.

## Design
### Colour Scheme and Imagery:

Above is the colour scheme for the Shoots & Seeds website, courtesy of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).  

For this site, I wanted a colour scheme which connoted plants and flowers that also provided multiple high-contrast pairings. For example: Amber and Blue Sapphire, and Honeydew and Dark Purple. Dartmouth green provides a backdrop for the rest of the colours to visually pop a little more and I think also helps the site feel a bit more cozy and inviting. All of the imagery used on the site contains shades of pink or green in reference to the scheme to create cohesion and to make sure the images don't stand out for the wrong reasons.

### Typography:
![Image demonstrating the fonts used on the Shoots & Seeds website](assets/images/shoots-seeds-fontpair.png)  
Above is a depiction of the fonts used on the website: "Playfair Display" and "Lato", courtesy of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/about) and [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all).  

Playfair Display is the font used for all of the site headers, I liked this font for this website because it feels very organic and natural in a way that reminds me of plants and vines. It also has enough quirkiness to be appealing without being difficult to read. I paired this with Lato because the fonts convene nicely in a non-disturbing way. I also like Lato because it is simple which makes it easier to read and ensures that is doesn't distract from the already bold Playfair Display.

## Features
### Header

The header of the website features the main logo on the left and the navigation links to all of the pages of the website on the right. The logo also links back to the home page. Both the logo and all of the links provide feedback to the user when hovered over by changing colour.  

### Hero Image

The hero image provides the first impression to the user upon launching the site. I made the text large so that it would be memorable and encourage the user to explore the rest of the site.  

### About Us Section
![About Us section of Shoots & Seeds website](assets/images/shoots-seeds-about.png)  

The about us section is divided into 3 sub-sections so that the information is less imposing and easier to digest for the user. The text and background colour provide high-contrast for ease of reading and I also used some [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons alongside the three sub-section titles to add some visual appeal.
